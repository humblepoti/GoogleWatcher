# GoogleWatcher
A small script developed to search for keywords on Google to identify malicious advertising urls comparing them to known domains on the search return.

It is necessary to edit the config.json file with the desired input.

It best suits with a crontab to periodically run. It also creates "log" files in pickle format separated by year, month and day.

Please feel free to contribute with the code.
